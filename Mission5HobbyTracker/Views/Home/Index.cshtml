<div class="cougs-content">
    @* Paragraph 1 — introduces the hobby and what makes it special *@
    <p class="mb-4">
        BYU vintage apparel collecting is more than a hobby—it's a journey through Cougars history. Each piece tells a story, 
        from classic Sailor Cougar tees to retro letterman styles. Whether you're hunting for that perfect throwback hoodie 
        or a vintage tri-blend tee, BYU vintage fashion offers unique styles that honor the tradition of Cougar nation.
    </p>
    @* Paragraph 2 — describes the experience of hunting for vintage items *@
    <p class="mb-4">
        The thrill of the hunt is real. Scouring thrift stores, campus sales, and vintage shops in search of hidden BYU gems 
        builds both your collection and your eye for quality. Learning to spot authentic vintage Cougars logos, 
        recognize quality construction, and identify classic designs transforms casual shopping into a rewarding skill. 
        Before you know it, you'll be the one friends call when they need advice on dating a garment or finding that rare piece.
    </p>
    @* Paragraph 3 — highlights the sustainability aspect of the hobby *@
    <p class="mb-4">
        Sustainability meets school spirit in vintage BYU fashion. By giving pre-loved Cougars apparel a second life, you're 
        reducing waste and supporting a circular economy. Plus, vintage pieces are often made with superior craftsmanship 
        and materials compared to fast fashion. It's a hobby that's as good for the planet as it is for your game day wardrobe.
